Perfect — now it’s clear. So, the project is about **Tweet Content Simulation** where you:

* Use **VLM (Vision-Language Model)** to extract visual context from media URLs (images/videos/gifs).
* Combine that visual embedding with text-based tweet metadata (company, username, timestamp, etc.)
* Fine-tune a **LLM (Mistral)** on this enriched dataset to generate tweet content conditioned on both text and visual features.

I’ll generate a **complete `README.md`** that:
✅ Explains the **project objective**,
✅ Highlights the **methodology** (VLM → data enrichment → LLM fine-tuning),
✅ Details **setup and dependencies**,
✅ Guides the user on **how to execute both notebooks (`vlm.ipynb` and `llm.ipynb`)**,
✅ Includes a **sample workflow**, and
✅ Provides **clear folder structure** and **evaluation details**.

Here’s your final **README.md** 👇

# 🚀 Tweet Content Simulation using VLM + LLM

## 📘 Overview

This project tackles **Task 2: Content Simulation**, where the goal is to **generate tweet content** based on tweet metadata (company, username, media URL, timestamp, likes).
To achieve this, we use a **two-stage pipeline**:

1. **Visual-Language Model (VLM)** — Extracts visual embeddings from media URLs (image/video/gif).
2. **Large Language Model (LLM)** — Fine-tuned Mistral model that takes both metadata and visual embeddings to generate tweet-like textual content.

---

## 🧠 Method of Approach (Core Idea)

### 1️⃣ Visual Feature Extraction (VLM.ipynb)

* Model Used: A pretrained **Vision-Language Model (e.g., CLIP, BLIP, or LLaVA)**.
* Input: Media URL (photo, video, or gif).
* The media is downloaded and processed to obtain a **visual embedding vector**.
* This embedding is stored in a new column in the CSV (e.g., `vlm_features`).

> 💡 Think of it as the model "describing" the image — capturing color, object, and context clues that correlate with tweet tone or brand theme.

---

### 2️⃣ Data Enrichment

* The **original tweet metadata CSV** (date, username, likes, company, media URL)
  is augmented with **visual embeddings** from the VLM stage.
* The resulting CSV now becomes **multimodal** — containing both text and visual context.

---

### 3️⃣ Tweet Generation (LLM.ipynb)

* Model Used: **Mistral 7B (fine-tuned)**.
* The enriched data (metadata + visual embeddings) is tokenized and used to fine-tune Mistral.
* Objective: Generate realistic tweet content that matches the company’s tone and visual context.

> ⚙️ The fine-tuned Mistral model learns to write tweet text *conditioned* on what it “sees” from the VLM.

---

### 4️⃣ Evaluation

Two test regimes are used:

1. **Unseen Brands (Seen Time Period)** — Tests generalization to new companies.
2. **Unseen Time Period (Seen Brands)** — Tests temporal consistency in tweet style.

Metrics:

* BLEU / ROUGE for content quality.
* Embedding similarity for semantic alignment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tweet-content-simulation.git
cd tweet-content-simulation
```

### 2️⃣ Create and activate a virtual environment

## 🚀 How to Run

### Step 1: Run the Vision-Language Model Notebook

Open **`vlm.ipynb`** in Jupyter and execute all cells.

This will:

* Download the pretrained VLM (e.g., CLIP).
* Process each media URL.
* Generate embeddings.
* Save the enriched CSV file (`enriched_train.csv`).

---

### Step 2: Run the LLM Fine-tuning Notebook

Open **`llm.ipynb`** and execute it.

This will:

* Load the enriched dataset.
* Fine-tune Mistral using metadata + VLM features.
* Save the trained model checkpoint.

---

### Step 3: Generate Tweets

Use the inference cell at the end of `llm.ipynb`:

```python
generate_tweet(company="Toyota", username="Toyota_Fortuner", media_url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/abc.jpg", likes=50)
```

Output example:

```
"Rugged terrain? No problem. The Fortuner is built for adventure — explore beyond limits!"
```

## 💡 Highlights of the Approach

| Stage           | Model          | Role                             | Output                  |
| --------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 1️⃣ VLM         | CLIP / BLIP    | Extracts visual semantics        | Visual Embedding Vector |
| 2️⃣ Data Fusion | Pandas + Numpy | Combines metadata & embeddings   | Enriched Dataset        |
| 3️⃣ LLM         | Mistral 7B     | Learns multimodal tweet patterns | Generated Tweet Text    |

---

## 🧩 Future Improvements

* Use **multi-frame extraction** for videos/GIFs.
* Apply **LoRA-based fine-tuning** for faster LLM adaptation.
* Introduce **sentiment control** or **brand tone conditioning**.

---

## 🏁 Results Summary

The model learns to:

* Generate realistic tweets consistent with the company style.
* Adapt to unseen companies or unseen time periods.
* Leverage both text and image context for higher relevance.
